Coding Dojo MEAN stack, Message Board assignment    

<h1>Assignment Note</h1>
This assignment was modified after completion. The assignment was modularized for the 
CD MEAN Modularized Mongoose Dashboard, which is included in the readme below. 
Note: I did not modularize the mongoose dashboard, rather, I modularized this Message Board app for the assignment. 

<h3>First Assignment: Message Board</h3>
For this assignment, you will create a simple single page message board that allows users to create messages, and comment on existing messages. Follow the wireframe below:

1. Make sure all the forms validate for presence
2. Make sure the name field contains no less than 4 characters
3. Have only 2 folders within your main project folder, 'views' and 'node_modules'
4. Put all models and controllers within your server.js
5. When the page loads, it will load all of the messages and all of the comments for each message.

<h3>Second Assignment: Modularized Mongoose Dashboard</h3>

For this assignment, we want you to modularize the Mongoose Dashboard you did in the last chapter.

<strong>To-do</strong>
1. Create a clone of a completed Mongoose Dashboard
